        Germany has been known to be the best place
        in Europe to travel to for ages. It is a wonderful opportunity to relax
        or to be adventurous. There will always be something for you for example the Berlin
        Film Festival also known as The Berlinale. It is one of the biggest tourist attractions
        in Germany right now. However, tourist that come for thrill seeking can always go up the
        mountain for some snowboarding or skiing.

        Iceland is well known for their beautiful
        mountains and its long valleys. The North of Iceland
        has several places that are attracting to tourist. The
        mystical landscapes are one of the many things that keep
        tourist coming back. Plenty of hot springs and volcanic snow-covered
        mountains. With its ice fields it is something you will not forget.
        Once you arrive in Iceland you will be greeted by the folks at the
        airport with a smile.

        It is no surprise that Belgium is famous for its architecture. The towns are
        amazing and none of them are the same. If you don not want to admire the city you can also enjoy plenty of
        specialties
        in Belgium. They have delicious Belgium Waffles which you can put whip cream or strawberries on top. Also, there
        is the national comfort food French
        fries for when you want a quick snack and are on the go. Don not forget to ask for mayonnaise since it is freshly
        made at the stores.
